# Pricing
Azure Cloud Shell is provided for free, with Azure Files incurring regular costs.

## Storage
Attaching storage via `createclouddrive` incurs regular storage costs. This includes any files and the default 5GB image used to persist your $HOME directory.

Check [here for details on Azure Files costs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/files/).
