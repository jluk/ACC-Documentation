# Using the console window
This document explains how to use the Azure Cloud Console window.

## Copy/paste
* Windows: Ctrl-insert and Shift-insert or right-click dropdown to copy/paste
  * FireFox/IE may not support clipboard permissions properly
* Mac OS: Cmd-c and Cmd-v or right-click dropdown to copy/paste

## Resize console window
* Click and drag the toolbar up or down to resize the console window

## Minimize & restore console window (coming soon)
* Click the minimize icon on the top right of the console to set window size to zero.
* Click the restore icon on the top right or the console to restore console to previous size.

## Scrolling text display
* Use your mouse wheel or trackpad while browser focus is on the Cloud Console

## Exit
Typing `exit` in the console will deallocate your container for recycling. This occurs by default after 10 minutes of zero console output.
