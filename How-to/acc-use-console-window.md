# Using the console window
This document explains how to use the Azure Cloud Console window.

## Copy Paste
* Cmd-C and Cmd-V to copy paste on Mac
* Right-click to select copy or paste

## Adjusting window size
The console window lives along the GUI portal for easy interface swapping. You can adjust the window in multiple ways to suit your preference.

### Resize console
* Click and drag the toolbar up or down to resize the console.

### Minimize & Restore (coming soon)
* Click the minimize icon on the right side of the toolbar to set console size to zero.
* Click restore icon on right side of the toolbar to restore console size to previous size.

## Scrolling text display
You can scroll the console display by: <br>
* Scrolling with your mouse wheel like any regular website

## Exit
Typing `exit` in the console will deallocate your container for recycling. This occurs by default after 10 minutes of zero console output.
